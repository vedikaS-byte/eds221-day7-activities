# Data Wrangling with the birds dataset

### Task 1 
Read in the data sets and store the data frames as bird_observations, sites, surveys, and taxalist (it should be clear from the raw file names which is which). Create a subset of bird_observations called birds_subset that only contains observations for birds with species id “BHCO” and “RWBL”, and from sites with site ID “LI-W” and “NU-C”. 
```{r}
library()
read_csv(here::here("data", "knb-lter-cap.256.9","52_pp52_birds_1.csv"))
```
